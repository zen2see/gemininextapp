The scene is very dark, also move the items closer to the center
Can you center all three
it appears all the elements are not in the center but appear to be aligned to the right (if I am looking at the screen) by about 100-200 pixels
Please continue.
Please continue.
I mean centered vertically, if I expand the screen or make the screen smaller, they should all still be centered
Can you revert that change and also Error: Suspense is not defined

can you revert back to the setup you had before adding the lines
Now can you sepearate the head, prompt and button into their own canvas, move the head up from the prompt
missing the prompt
Please continue.

Please continue.
all items are too small and still off center
Please continue.
Please continue.
Please continue.

Please continue.
Please continue.
Please continue.

Please continue.
Please continue.
Please continue.
can you move the head to it's right
I meant to the left
can you move it again to center it
why isn't the head at the center of the screen
still not centered
can you do it again
I don't see the text for the prompt, the prompt window is too small and the button is too big
can you increase the prompt size and double the head size
can you put a light green border around the prompt
can you double the height of the prompt
can you increase the size of the prompt text (same size as the button text)  and move the button down by 10 pixels
button seems to be behinds something and prompt text needs to be increased by 10 time
can you increase the widthe of the preompt box to fit the word enter your prompt here... in one line
reduce the text by 1/4 and make and why is the button hidden behind something
can you compare the text size with the green color of the prompt interface? It should be the same size
no can you revert that text change and tell me the length of the green color in the prompt
how to have the text in the input box wrap when it reaches the width of the green border
what happened to the font on the button it is no longer displaying
Please continue.
can you compile all my above questiongs to one text file?
